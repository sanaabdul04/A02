Part 1: Using Git and GitHub with WebStorm

Step 1: Installing Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. If you haven't already installed Git on your system, you can download it from the official website: Git Download.

Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

Step 2: Setting up Git
After installing Git, open your terminal (command prompt on Windows) and configure your Git username and email address using the following commands:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

Step 3: Installing WebStorm
WebStorm is an integrated development environment (IDE) for web development that includes Git integration. If you haven't installed WebStorm, you can download it from the official website: WebStorm Download.

Download the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

Step 4: Creating a GitHub Account
If you don't have a GitHub account, go to the GitHub website: GitHub and sign up for a free account.
Step 5: Creating a New Repository on GitHub
Log in to your GitHub account and click on the "New" button to create a new repository. Fill in the repository name and other details as needed.
Step 6: Cloning a Repository in WebStorm
Open WebStorm, and from the welcome screen, select "Check out from Version Control" and choose Git. Enter the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.
Step 7: Creating a New Branch
In WebStorm, you can create a new branch by clicking on the branch icon in the bottom right corner of the window. Give your branch a descriptive name.
Step 8: Making Changes and Committing
Make changes to your code within WebStorm. When you're ready to commit, go to the "VCS" menu, select "Git," and choose "Commit." Add a commit message describing your changes and click "Commit."
Step 9: Pushing Changes to GitHub
After committing your changes, you can push them to GitHub by going to the "VCS" menu, selecting "Git," and choosing "Push." This will update your branch on GitHub.
Step 10: Pulling Changes from GitHub
To get the latest changes from GitHub, use the "VCS" menu, select "Git," and choose "Pull." This will update your local copy of the repository.
Step 11: Merging Changes
To merge changes from one branch into another, create a merge request on GitHub or use the "VCS" menu in WebStorm, select "Git," and choose "Merge Changes." Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.
Step 12: Managing Remotes
You can manage your remotes (e.g., adding or removing) through the "VCS" menu in WebStorm. This allows you to connect to different repositories.
Congratulations! You've successfully set up Git and GitHub with WebStorm and can now collaborate on code projects.
